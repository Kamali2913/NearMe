        Shri Ulagalantha Perumal Temple is a famous and ancient Vishnu temple located in Kanchipuram. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in the form of Trivikrama, where He is shown with one leg raised to measure the sky and the other covering the Earth, based on the Vamana avatar story. The temple has a massive idol of over 35 feet, which is one of the tallest Vishnu images in South India. The architecture includes beautiful mandapams, stone pillars, and carvings that reflect the Chola and Vijayanagara styles.
