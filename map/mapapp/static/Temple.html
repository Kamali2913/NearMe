        Kachabeswarar Temple is a well-known Shiva temple in Kanchipuram. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Kachabeswarar. According to legend, Lord Vishnu took the form of a tortoise (Kurma avatar) and worshipped Shiva at this place to gain strength during the churning of the ocean. The temple is built in traditional Dravidian style with a tall gopuram, spacious corridors, and beautifully carved pillars. The peaceful atmosphere, sacred tank, and ancient shrines make it an important spiritual destination. The temple is also known for its historical significance and unique mythological connection.
